##Formal Languages and Finite Automata
---
The main objective of the course is to introduce the fundamental notions about **formal languages** (Chomsky classification of Languages, Regular Languages, Automata, Context Free Grammars, Push Down Automata, Turing Machine) and understand the mechanisms governing the analysis and synthesis of **programming languages**.
Students will learn the most important techniques for the representation and generation of Languages (in particular, regular and context-free languages).
